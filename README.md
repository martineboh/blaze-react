# Blaze React (0.4.0 preview-release)
> **Blaze React** is a [Meteor](http://meteor.com) package which give you templates for React in a familiar [Blaze API](https://www.meteor.com/blaze) (giving you **helpers**, **events**, **onRendered**, **onCreated** etc) with a subset of [Spacebars](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spacebars/README.md) (aka Meteor flavored Handlebars).

**Why React?** – Well it gives us faster pageloads, SEO without Spiderable, accessibility for users without JavaScript and general improvements in page rendering speed.

**Why a Blaze/Spacebars API?** – Well it's way easier to learn and get started with, can't argue against that right (see examples below)?


## Installation

```bash
meteor add timbrandin:blaze-react
```

## Getting started

> Currently this project is in flux until we have a preview-release, partly due to the announcement from MDG in developing a similar package that builds templates for React, but we think we can give this to you earlier than within a few months and with support for most of Blaze 1 features and Spacebars.
